# Mechatronics-Design-II

Course Description:
Interweaves mechanisms, electronics, sensors, and control strategies with software and information technology to examine the demands and ideas of customers and find the most efficient, cost-effective method to transform their goals into successful commercial products. Most of the term is devoted to a significant design project in which student groups work independently and competitively, applying the design process to a project goal set by the faculty co-ordinator.
